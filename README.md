# Etch-a-Sketch
<hr>



This project was created as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) and can be ran at https://chrisjwirth.github.io/odin_etch_a_sketch/.

The features include:
- The ability to select between B&W and Color;
- The ability to select the number of squares used per side (a greater density of squares will result in a smaller brush stroke); and 
- The buildup of opacity (each pass over the same square will increase the opacity until 100% opacity is achieved).
